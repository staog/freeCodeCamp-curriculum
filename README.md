# freeCodeCamp-curriculum
I'm starting with new freeCodeCamp curriculum and I will be logging my progress here.

freeCodeCamp.org is a tiny non-profit that's helping millions of people learn to code for free. They have new curriculum and thousands of coding lessons to help you improve your coding skills. One can earn each certification by completing its 5 final projects. All of that is 100% free, thanks to the thousands of campers who donate to their nonprofit.
